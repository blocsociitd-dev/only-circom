# Variable Subarray Problem

## Problem statement

### input signals

1. in[1000]

2. start (integer in [0,1000))

3. end (integer in [0,1000))

### Output signals

1. out[1000]

### Constraints

1. the first values of out are the values at indices [start, end) of in

2. the remainder of out is 0-padded

## Example test case

in[6] = {1,5,3,4,7,9}

start = 2

end = 4

Expected output:

out[6] = [3,4,0,0,0,0]
